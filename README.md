There are a few issues with the code you posted:

   -  Missing commas: There are missing commas between the key-value pairs in the fruitdict dictionary.
    -Scope of fol: The variable fol should be defined within the main() function for proper scope management.
    -Incorrect usage of items(): The in check should be done against the keys of the dictionary, not the items.
    -Using key and value variables: You need to retrieve the value associated with the key from the dictionary.
